These data are incorporated into Jon Paige's dissertation focused on comparative studies of stone tool traditions. 

Data collection for this study was funded through generous support from the Leakey Foundation,
GPSA at Arizona State University, and the School of Human Evolution and Social Change, at Arizona State University.
